This is a backup of myself work in ELEC5616 Skynet Project in 2019S1.
Note: This version is final version and the previous work has been also uploaded to Phabricator.
Phabricator ID: Obj-704
Just want to backup in my own repository to "record" my study progress...
May has differences with Phabricator version because the version in there is a group negotiate result.

5/9/2019: Should be final version of Part 2
5/11/2019: Really final version of Part 2

Below is original README in project 1

Welcome to SkyNet

Usage: Peer to Peer (Echo)
(Note: Requires two bots at the same time)

Enter command: p2p echo

Original data: b'ECHO'
Encrypted data: b'!qpz'
Sending packet of length 4
Echo> Test
Original data: b'Test'
Encrypted data: b'0WKA'
Sending packet of length 4
Receiving packet of length 4

Original data: b'Test'
Echo> exit
Original data: b'exit'
Encrypted data: b'\x01JQA'
Sending packet of length 4
Receiving packet of length 4
Encrypted data: b'\x01JQA'
Original data: b'exit'

Notice: 'Test' and 'exit' are sent and received as the same encrypted message.
This means it's vulnerable to frequency analysis. When 'a' is sent multiple times,
it ends up "looping" as we're using a simple repeated XOR cypher.
This is something that should be fixed.
